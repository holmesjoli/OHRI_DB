# Data summary

Data were collected from two decision aid repositories: the [Ottawa
Hospital Research Institute (OHRI) Patient Decision
Aid](https://decisionaid.ohri.ca/) library and the [Mayo Clinic’s
Knowledge and Evaluation Research Unit
(Mayo)](https://www.mayo.edu/research/labs/knowledge-evaluation-research-unit/overview).
Jointly, the libraries contain 308 decision aids. Researchers filtered
out decision aids that have inactive links. Additionally, decision aids
were excluded if they are not available in English, resulting in a
sample of size of 262.

The resulting sample of decision aids were creating overwhelmingly by
one developer, Healthwise. Healthwise represents 58.8% of the data
subset. The developer that represents the second largest proportion of
the sample is Mayo Clinic (9.9%).

The decision aids represent a large variety of conditions (n = 130),
varying from across permanent/temporary/situation, … life-threatening
illnesses such as cancer, temporary health situations such as pregnancy
and behavioral health choices such as contraception.
